You cannot create a file with / in the filename. You could do it this way:

#!/bin/bash

while IFS= read -r line
do
    echo "LINE: $line"

    if [[ "$line" != "" ]]
    then
        filename="${line#https://}"
        echo "FILENAME: $filename"
        
        # YOUR CURL COMMAND HERE, USING $filename
    fi
done < url.txt


it ignores empty lines
variable substitution is used to remove the https:// part of each URL
this will allow you to create the file



Note: if your URLs containt sub-directories, they must be removed as well.

Ex: you want to do https://www.exemple.com/some/sub/dir The script I suggested here would try to create a file named "www.exemple.com/some/sub/dir". In this case, you could replace the / with _ using tr.

The script would become:


#!/bin/bash

while IFS= read -r line
do
    echo "LINE: $line"

    if [[ "$line" != "" ]]
    then
        filename=$(echo "$line" | tr '/' '_')
        filename2=${filename#https:__}
        echo "FILENAME: $filename2"

        # YOUR CURL COMMAND HERE, USING $filename2
    fi
done < url.txt
